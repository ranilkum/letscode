# My Coding Projects

This repository contains a collection of small but useful projects I'm building. Each project is designed to solve a common problem in a simple way.

## Projects

A tool that uses AI to extract key points and action items from meeting transcripts.
- **Tech**: Python, FastAPI, LLM
- **Status**: In development

## Project Structure

Each project has its own folder with:

## About

I'm challenging myself to build small, useful projects that can be completed in a day. Each project solves a real problem and uses practical technology combinations.

Feel free to use any of these projects or contribute improvements!
